# Percolation

In general, percolation describes the behavior of clusters connected in a random graph.
One may wonder whether or not taken a sample of porous material, liquid poured on one face can reach another through the holes that occupy a fraction of the volume of the material. 

From a purely mathematical point of view, taken a system of complex networks, where the sites can be bound with probability p (corresponding to the passage of liquid between neighboring sites) or closed with probability 1-p; You want to find the probability of obtaining an open path or a path that runs through the connected neighboring sites, such as to connect the ends of the lattice.
